things i remember having to do on steve's laptop:

1. make sure you have intellij, java, tomcat, gradle
2. do a svn checkout of the project
3. get a copy of server.xml with the security realm
4. get a copy of hicks-eoi.jar and hicks-common.jar
5. get a copy of the user avatar images
6. get a copy of the bts.properties file


new streamlined steps:

1. make sure you have intellij, java, tomcat, gradle
2. do a svn checkout of the project
3. refer to server-sample.xml to configure your server.xml (maybe it can just be copied over?)
4. from dropbox shared folder, get a copy of hicks-eoi.jar and hicks-common.jar. Put in c:/javalib/
5. rename bts-sample.properties to bts.properties. It is intentionally missing the password so emails won't work.
